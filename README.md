android-test-automation
=======================

A home for various experiments with test automation for the Android platform. This includes some utility code that helps with discovering and debugging. This code is *not* even close to production quality.

The project's wiki https://github.com/julianharty/android-test-automation/wiki provides some information on a 2-day hands-on, experiential workshop for Android Test Automation.
